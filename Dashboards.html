        time periods. They are usually shown on the X-axis or in segments in charts.</li>
    <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> represent numerical values or quantities in your data, e.g., sales, number of clicks,

</ul>

<h3 id="using-filters">Using Filters:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Filters allow you to focus on specific subsets of data and avoid irrelevant results.</li>
    <li>Combine filters to create more detailed views of your data.</li>
